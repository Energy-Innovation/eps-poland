# CreateContributionTestScript.py
#
# Developed by Jeffrey Rissman
#
# This is a Python script that is used to generate a Vensim command script.
# The Vensim command script will perform one run with all enabled policies
# and one run with each defined subset (or "group") within the set of enabled
# policies turned off or turned on (depending on a user setting in this script).


# File Names
# ----------
# Rather than including input and output file names in the code below, we assign all the file
# names to variables in this section.  This allows the names to be easily changed if desired.
ModelFile = "EPS.mdl" # The name of the Vensim model file (typically with .mdl or .vpm extension)
OutputScript = "GeneratedContributionTestScript.cmd" # The desired filename of the Vensim command script to be generated
RunResultsFile = "ContributionTestResults.tsv" # The desired filename for TSV file containing model run results
OutputVarsFile = "OutputVarsToExport.lst" # The name of the file containing a list of variables to be included in the RunResultsFile
                                          # May optionally also be used as a SAVELIST for Vensim (see below)

# Other Settings
# --------------
RunName = "MostRecentRun" # The desired name for all runs performed.  Used as the filename for the VDF files that Vensim creates
EnableOrDisableGroups = "Disable" # Should each group be enabled or disabled in turn?
								 # Essentially, this is testing either the contribution of a group in the proximity of the
								 # BAU case ("Enable") or in the proximity of a scenario defined in the non-zero values of
								 # the policies listed below ("Disable").


# Index definitions
# -----------------
# Each policy is a Python list.  The numbers below are a key to the meaning of the four entries
# that compose each policy, so we can refer to them by meaningful names in the code.
# Note that the fourth entry in each policy, Settings, is itself a list that contains various
# setting values.  Do not change any names or numbers in this section.
Enabled = 0
LongName = 1
ShortName = 2
Settings = 3
Group = 4


# Policy Options
# --------------
# This section specifies which policies should be included in the Vensim command script
# (called here "enabled" policies) and what setting values for those policies should
# be included.  Unless you have enabled "IndividualPoliciesOnly" mode, all non-repeating
# combinations of the settings for enabled policies will
# be included in the Vensim command script, so do not enable too many policies at once, or
# Vensim will be unable to complete the necessary runs in a reasonable amount of time.
# Each policy is on a single line.  You may change the first entry of each policy to
# "True" to enable the policy or "False" to disable it.
# The fourth entry in each policy is a list of setting values enclosed with square brackets.
# You may change these values, add more values (separated by commas), and delete values.
# Any enabled policy must have a minimum of one setting value.  A policy that is disabled
# and a policy with a setting of zero produce identical results.
# The fifth entry in each policy is its group number.  By default, each policy has its
# own group number.  Change these numbers so multiple policies share a group number (or a
# group name in quotes, like "financial policies") to cause them to be enabled or disabled
# together.
